# Tic.Tac.Toe
The code is an implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe in Python. It allows two players to take turns placing their respective symbols, "X" and "O," on a 3x3 grid. The game provides a visual representation of the board and checks for a winning condition or a tie after each move.
